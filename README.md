A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 4.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Configuration

Read and edit the environment specific `config/app_local.php` and setup the 
`'Datasources'` and any other configuration relevant for your application.
Other environment agnostic settings can be changed in `config/app.php`.

## Installation

With this command, install what is necessary to run this application.
```bash
composer install
```

Use migrations, to create database structure and load sample data on which the application will work.
```bash
bin/cake migrations migrate
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.


## Layout

The app skeleton uses Bootstrap  v5.2.1 (https://getbootstrap.com/) by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.
